# Spatio_Temporal-Relations-in-One-Dimensional-Representation
Modelling theory for the spatio-temporal relations found on the one dimensional representation
You can navigate the files as following:
  - The sfc file contains the OneDimensionalGraph notebook where we worked on the Snowfoxdata.
  - In sfc > Comma2k19, you can find the evaluate and improve notebook. In Evaluate, we evaluated the modelling theory we got from the Snowfoxdata and applied it to the comma2k19 data.       As for the Improve, we adjusted our modelling theory according to the comma2k19 dataset and imroved it.
  - In  sfc > Comma2k19 > RightLaneChanges we applied our modelling theory the same way bit for right lane change we got from another team.
